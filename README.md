## Lab 2 - Audio Filtering, the FFT, and Doppler Shifts
In this lab, we use a fast Fourier transform to calculate the frequencies of highest magnitude being picked up by the iPhone's microphone. We also make use of Doppler shifts to determine if someone is moving their hand towards or away from the microphone.

## Lab 3 - Core Motion and SpriteKit
This app tracks your walking in the background and rewards you with a game! If you pass your step goal for the day, you get to play Asteroid Dodge: a game where you guide a spaceship through an asteroid field.
